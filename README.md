## Applications of Breadth First Travesal

1. Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree
2. Peer to Peer Networks (Bittorrent) (Breadth First Search)
3. Crawelers in Search Engines
4. Social Networks Websites (Find people within the distance "k" using Breadth first search)
- You’re interested in company X. You want to find someone who works at company X in your network. You’d prefer to find someone who is ‘closer’ to you; a first-degree connection is much more preferable than a fourth-degree connection. This is perfect for a BFS. You first search your first-degree connections (added first) before you search your second-degree connections (their friends) and so on.
5. GPS Navigation Search systems
6. Broadcasting in Networks
7. Important for self-driving cars

## Applications of Depth First Search
1. For a weighted graph, DFS traversal of the graph produces the minimum spanning tree and all pair shortest path tree.
